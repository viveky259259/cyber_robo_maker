##Motivation
In the future, no doubt that robots will be the cyber world assistant of humans. Assistants are personal, so there must be a way to personalize their overall structure. Robo Maker will help users to build their own robot, having their own strengths and special abilities and share their builds on social media.


##offer
We as flutter developers wanted to try out that can flutter create a robot with drag and drop feature. Can we export the robot to showcase our creation? And at the end of the hackathon with the help of 5 members, we are capable to produce a beautiful interactive app in the cyberpunk theme that lets users generate a robot using drag and drop features. Additionally, he can share his robot with the social world.  Tech Used: Flutter, AudioPlayer, and Lottie.
